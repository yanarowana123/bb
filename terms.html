    <p>2. Use Licence</p>

    <div>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Premium
        heater's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a licence, not a
        transfer of title, and under this licence you may not:
        <p>– modify or copy the materials;</p>
        <p>– use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</p>
        <p> – attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Premium heater's website;</p>
        <p> – remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or transfer the materials to
            another
            person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</p>

        This licence shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by
        Premium heater at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this
        licence, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed
        format.

        expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation,
